		Labels are used to group WorkerMessages. For example, a worker_message about a particular container might have the labels: { "JOB_ID": "2015-04-22", "WORKER_ID": "wordcount-vm-2015â€¦" "CONTAINER_TYPE": "worker", "CONTAINER_ID": "ac1234def"} Label tags typically correspond to Label enum values. However, for ease of development other strings can be used as tags. LABEL_UNSPECIFIED should not be used here.
