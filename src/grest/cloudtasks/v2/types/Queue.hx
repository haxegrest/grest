		Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue's state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
