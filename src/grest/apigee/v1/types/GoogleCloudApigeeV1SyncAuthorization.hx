		Entity tag (ETag) used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates from overwriting each other. For example, when you call [getSyncAuthorization](organizations/getSyncAuthorization) an ETag is returned in the response. Pass that ETag when calling the [setSyncAuthorization](organizations/setSyncAuthorization) to ensure that you are updating the correct version. If you don't pass the ETag in the call to `setSyncAuthorization`, then the existing authorization is overwritten indiscriminately. **Note**: We strongly recommend that you use the ETag in the read-modify-write cycle to avoid race conditions.

The service-account-name is formatted like an email address.
