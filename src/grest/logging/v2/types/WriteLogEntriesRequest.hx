		Required. The log entries to send to Logging. The order of log entries in this list does not matter. Values supplied in this method's log_name, resource, and labels fields are copied into those log entries in this list that do not include values for their corresponding fields. For more information, see the LogEntry type.If the timestamp or insert_id fields are missing in log entries, then this method supplies the current time or a unique identifier, respectively. The supplied values are chosen so that, among the log entries that did not supply their own values, the entries earlier in the list will sort before the entries later in the list. See the entries.list method.Log entries with timestamps that are more than the logs retention period (https://cloud.google.com/logging/quota-policy) in the past or more than 24 hours in the future will not be available when calling entries.list. However, those log entries can still be exported with LogSinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).To improve throughput and to avoid exceeding the quota limit (https://cloud.google.com/logging/quota-policy) for calls to entries.write, you should try to include several log entries in this list, rather than calling this method for each individual log entry.
