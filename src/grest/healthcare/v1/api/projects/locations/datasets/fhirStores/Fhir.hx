If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. The resources in scope for the response are: * The patient resource itself. * All the resources directly referenced by the patient resource. * Resources directly referencing the patient resource that meet the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria are based on the membership rules in the patient compartment definition ([DSTU2](http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/compartment-patient.html), [STU3](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/compartmentdefinition-patient.html), [R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/compartmentdefinition-patient.html)), which details the eligible resource types and referencing search parameters.

Supported search modifiers: `:missing`, `:exact`, `:contains`, `:text`, `:in`, `:not-in`, `:above`, `:below`, `:[type]`, `:not`, and `:recurse`. Supported search result parameters: `_sort`, `_count`, `_include`, `_revinclude`, `_summary=text`, `_summary=data`, and `_elements`. The maximum number of search results returned defaults to 100, which can be overridden by the `_count` parameter up to a maximum limit of 1000. If there are additional results, the returned `Bundle` will contain pagination links. Resources with a total size larger than 5MB or a field count larger than 50,000 might not be fully searchable as the server might trim its generated search index in those cases. Note: FHIR resources are indexed asynchronously, so there might be a slight delay between the time a resource is created or changes and when the change is reflected in search results.
