		Lists the backup long-running operations in the given instance. A backup operation has a name of the form `projects//instances//backups//operations/`. The long-running operation metadata field type `metadata.type_url` describes the type of the metadata. Operations returned include those that have completed/failed/canceled within the last 7 days, and pending operations. Operations returned are ordered by `operation.metadata.value.progress.start_time` in descending order starting from the most recently started operation.

		An expression that filters the list of returned backup operations. A filter expression consists of a field name, a comparison operator, and a value for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must be one of: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `=`, or `:`. Colon `:` is the contains operator. Filter rules are not case sensitive. The following fields in the operation are eligible for filtering: * `name` - The name of the long-running operation * `done` - False if the operation is in progress, else true. * `metadata.@type` - the type of metadata. For example, the type string for CreateBackupMetadata is `type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.database.v1.CreateBackupMetadata`. * `metadata.` - any field in metadata.value. * `error` - Error associated with the long-running operation. * `response.@type` - the type of response. * `response.` - any field in response.value. You can combine multiple expressions by enclosing each expression in parentheses. By default, expressions are combined with AND logic, but you can specify AND, OR, and NOT logic explicitly. Here are a few examples: * `done:true` - The operation is complete. * `metadata.database:prod` - The database the backup was taken from has a name containing the string "prod". * `(metadata.@type=type.googleapis.com/google.spanner.admin.database.v1.CreateBackupMetadata) AND` \ `(metadata.name:howl) AND` \ `(metadata.progress.start_time < \"2018-03-28T14:50:00Z\") AND` \ `(error:*)` - Returns operations where: * The operation's metadata type is CreateBackupMetadata. * The backup name contains the string "howl". * The operation started before 2018-03-28T14:50:00Z. * The operation resulted in an error.
