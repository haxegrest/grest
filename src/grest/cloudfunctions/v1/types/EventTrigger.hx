		Required. The type of event to observe. For example: `providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change` and `providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish`. Event types match pattern `providers/*/eventTypes/*.*`. The pattern contains: 1. namespace: For example, `cloud.storage` and `google.firebase.analytics`. 2. resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type `object`. 3. action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for a Google Cloud Storage Object is 'change'. These parts are lower case.

	/**
		Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for example, `projects/_/buckets/myBucket`. Not all syntactically correct values are accepted by all services. For example: 1. The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the same project as the `CloudFunction`. 2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an `event_type` of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have a resource that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics. Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an `EventTrigger`. These will always be returned in the normalized "long" format. See each *service's* documentation for supported formats.
