		Specifies the alignment of data points in individual time series as well as how to combine the retrieved time series together (such as when aggregating multiple streams on each resource to a single stream for each resource or when aggregating streams across all members of a group of resrouces). Multiple aggregations are applied in the order specified.This field is similar to the one in the ListTimeSeries request (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.timeSeries/list). It is advisable to use the ListTimeSeries method when debugging this field.

		The amount of time that a time series must fail to report new data to be considered failing. The minimum value of this field is 120 seconds. Larger values that are a multiple of a minute--for example, 240 or 300 seconds--are supported. If an invalid value is given, an error will be returned. The Duration.nanos field is ignored.

The filter must specify the metric type and the resource type. Optionally, it can specify resource labels and metric labels. This field must not exceed 2048 Unicode characters in length.
