		The amount of time that a time series must violate the threshold to be considered failing. Currently, only values that are a multiple of a minute--e.g., 0, 60, 120, or 300 seconds--are supported. If an invalid value is given, an error will be returned. When choosing a duration, it is useful to keep in mind the frequency of the underlying time series data (which may also be affected by any alignments specified in the aggregations field); a good duration is long enough so that a single outlier does not generate spurious alerts, but short enough that unhealthy states are detected and alerted on quickly.
