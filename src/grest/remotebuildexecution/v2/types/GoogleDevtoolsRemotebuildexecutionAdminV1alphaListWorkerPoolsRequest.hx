	/**
		Optional. A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. String values are case-insensitive. The comparison operator must be either `:`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<=` or `<`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. You can also filter on nested fields. To filter on multiple expressions, you can separate expression using `AND` and `OR` operators, using parentheses to specify precedence. If neither operator is specified, `AND` is assumed. Examples: Include only pools with more than 100 reserved workers: `(worker_count > 100) (worker_config.reserved = true)` Include only pools with a certain label or machines of the e2-standard family: `worker_config.labels.key1 : * OR worker_config.machine_type: e2-standard`
