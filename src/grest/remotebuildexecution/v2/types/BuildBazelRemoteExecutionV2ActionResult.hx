		The output directories of the action. For each output directory requested in the `output_directories` or `output_paths` field of the Action, if the corresponding directory existed after the action completed, a single entry will be present in the output list, which will contain the digest of a Tree message containing the directory tree, and the path equal exactly to the corresponding Action output_directories member. As an example, suppose the Action had an output directory `a/b/dir` and the execution produced the following contents in `a/b/dir`: a file named `bar` and a directory named `foo` with an executable file named `baz`. Then, output_directory will contain (hashes shortened for readability): ```json // OutputDirectory proto: { path: "a/b/dir" tree_digest: { hash: "4a73bc9d03...", size: 55 } } // Tree proto with hash "4a73bc9d03..." and size 55: { root: { files: [ { name: "bar", digest: { hash: "4a73bc9d03...", size: 65534 } } ], directories: [ { name: "foo", digest: { hash: "4cf2eda940...", size: 43 } } ] } children : { // (Directory proto with hash "4cf2eda940..." and size 43) files: [ { name: "baz", digest: { hash: "b2c941073e...", size: 1294, }, is_executable: true } ] } } ``` If an output of the same name as listed in `output_files` of the Command was found in `output_directories`, but was not a directory, the server will return a FAILED_PRECONDITION.
