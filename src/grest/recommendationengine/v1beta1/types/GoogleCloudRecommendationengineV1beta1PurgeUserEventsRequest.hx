		Required. The filter string to specify the events to be deleted. Empty string filter is not allowed. The eligible fields for filtering are: * `eventType`: UserEvent.eventType field of type string. * `eventTime`: in ISO 8601 "zulu" format. * `visitorId`: field of type string. Specifying this will delete all events associated with a visitor. * `userId`: field of type string. Specifying this will delete all events associated with a user. Examples: * Deleting all events in a time range: `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventTime < "2012-04-23T18:30:43.511Z"` * Deleting specific eventType in time range: `eventTime > "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" eventType = "detail-page-view"` * Deleting all events for a specific visitor: `visitorId = "visitor1024"` The filtering fields are assumed to have an implicit AND.
