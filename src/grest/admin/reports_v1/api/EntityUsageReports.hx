		The `filters` query string is a comma-separated list of an application's event parameters where the parameter's value is manipulated by a relational operator. The `filters` query string includes the name of the application whose usage is returned in the report. The application values for the Entities usage report include `accounts`, `docs`, and `gmail`. Filters are in the form `[application name]:parameter name[parameter value],...`. In this example, the `<>` 'not equal to' operator is URL-encoded in the request's query string (%3C%3E): GET https://www.googleapis.com/admin/reports/v1/usage/gplus_communities/all/dates/2017-12-01 ?parameters=gplus:community_name,gplus:num_total_members &filters=gplus:num_total_members%3C%3E0 The relational operators include: - `==` - 'equal to'. - `<>` - 'not equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3C%3E). - `<` - 'less than'. It is URL-encoded (%3C). - `<=` - 'less than or equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3C=). - `>` - 'greater than'. It is URL-encoded (%3E). - `>=` - 'greater than or equal to'. It is URL-encoded (%3E=). Filters can only be applied to numeric parameters.

		The `parameters` query string is a comma-separated list of event parameters that refine a report's results. The parameter is associated with a specific application. The application values for the Entities usage report are only `gplus`. A `parameter` query string is in the CSV form of `[app_name1:param_name1], [app_name2:param_name2]...`. *Note:* The API doesn't accept multiple values of a parameter. If a particular parameter is supplied more than once in the API request, the API only accepts the last value of that request parameter. In addition, if an invalid request parameter is supplied in the API request, the API ignores that request parameter and returns the response corresponding to the remaining valid request parameters. An example of an invalid request parameter is one that does not belong to the application. If no parameters are requested, all parameters are returned.
