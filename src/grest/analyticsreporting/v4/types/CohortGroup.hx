		Enable Life Time Value (LTV). LTV measures lifetime value for users acquired through different channels. Please see: [Cohort Analysis](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6074676) and [Lifetime Value](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6182550) If the value of lifetimeValue is false: - The metric values are similar to the values in the web interface cohort report. - The cohort definition date ranges must be aligned to the calendar week and month. i.e. while requesting `ga:cohortNthWeek` the `startDate` in the cohort definition should be a Sunday and the `endDate` should be the following Saturday, and for `ga:cohortNthMonth`, the `startDate` should be the 1st of the month and `endDate` should be the last day of the month. When the lifetimeValue is true: - The metric values will correspond to the values in the web interface LifeTime value report. - The Lifetime Value report shows you how user value (Revenue) and engagement (Appviews, Goal Completions, Sessions, and Session Duration) grow during the 90 days after a user is acquired. - The metrics are calculated as a cumulative average per user per the time increment. - The cohort definition date ranges need not be aligned to the calendar week and month boundaries. - The `viewId` must be an [app view ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2649553#WebVersusAppViews)
