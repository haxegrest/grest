	/**
		The cohort selects users whose first touch date is between start date and end date defined in the `dateRange`. This `dateRange` does not specify the full date range of event data that is present in a cohort report. In a cohort report, this `dateRange` is extended by the granularity and offset present in the `cohortsRange`; event data for the extended reporting date range is present in a cohort report. In a cohort request, this `dateRange` is required and the `dateRanges` in the `RunReportRequest` or `RunPivotReportRequest` must be unspecified. This `dateRange` should generally be aligned with the cohort's granularity. If `CohortsRange` uses daily granularity, this `dateRange` can be a single day. If `CohortsRange` uses weekly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a week boundary, starting at Sunday and ending Saturday. If `CohortsRange` uses monthly granularity, this `dateRange` can be aligned to a month, starting at the first and ending on the last day of the month.
