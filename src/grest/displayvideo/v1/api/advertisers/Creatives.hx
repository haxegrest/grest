		Allows filtering by creative properties. Supported syntax: * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions. * Restriction for the same field must be combined by `OR`. * Restriction for different fields must be combined by `AND`. * Between `(` and `)` there can only be restrictions combined by `OR` for the same field. * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`. * The operator must be `EQUALS (=)` for the following fields: - `entityStatus` - `creativeType`. - `dimensions` - `minDuration` - `maxDuration` - `approvalStatus` - `exchangeReviewStatus` - `dynamic` - `creativeId` * The operator must be `HAS (:)` for the following fields: - `lineItemIds` * For `entityStatus`, `minDuration`, `maxDuration`, and `dynamic` there may be at most one restriction. * For `dimensions`, the value is in the form of `"{width}x{height}"`. * For `exchangeReviewStatus`, the value is in the form of `{exchange}-{reviewStatus}`. * For `minDuration` and `maxDuration`, the value is in the form of `"{duration}s"`. Only seconds are supported with millisecond granularity. * There may be multiple `lineItemIds` restrictions in order to search against multiple possible line item IDs. * There may be multiple `creativeId` restrictions in order to search against multiple possible creative IDs. Examples: * All native creatives: `creativeType="CREATIVE_TYPE_NATIVE"` * All active creatives with 300x400 or 50x100 dimensions: `entityStatus="ENTITY_STATUS_ACTIVE" AND (dimensions="300x400" OR dimensions="50x100")` * All dynamic creatives that are approved by AdX or AppNexus, with a minimum duration of 5 seconds and 200ms. `dynamic="true" AND minDuration="5.2s" AND (exchangeReviewStatus="EXCHANGE_GOOGLE_AD_MANAGER-REVIEW_STATUS_APPROVED" OR exchangeReviewStatus="EXCHANGE_APPNEXUS-REVIEW_STATUS_APPROVED")` * All video creatives that are associated with line item ID 1 or 2: `creativeType="CREATIVE_TYPE_VIDEO" AND (lineItemIds:1 OR lineItemIds:2)` * Find creatives by multiple creative IDs: `creativeId=1 OR creativeId=2` The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
