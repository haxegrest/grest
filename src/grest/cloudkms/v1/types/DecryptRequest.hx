If specified, KeyManagementService will verify the integrity of the received DecryptRequest.additional_authenticated_data using this checksum. KeyManagementService will report an error if the checksum verification fails. If you receive a checksum error, your client should verify that CRC32C(DecryptRequest.additional_authenticated_data) is equal to DecryptRequest.additional_authenticated_data_crc32c, and if so, perform a limited number of retries. A persistent mismatch may indicate an issue in your computation of the CRC32C checksum. Note: This field is defined as int64 for reasons of compatibility across different languages. However, it is a non-negative integer, which will never exceed 2^32-1, and can be safely downconverted to uint32 in languages that support this type. NOTE: This field is in Beta.
