		The table range specifying which cells of the table to merge. Any text in the cells being merged will be concatenated and stored in the "head" cell of the range. This is the upper-left cell of the range when the content direction is left to right, and the upper-right cell of the range otherwise. If the range is non-rectangular (which can occur in some cases where the range covers cells that are already merged or where the table is non-rectangular), a 400 bad request error is returned.
