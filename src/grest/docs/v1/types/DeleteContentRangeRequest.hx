	/**
		The range of content to delete. Deleting text that crosses a paragraph boundary may result in changes to paragraph styles, lists, positioned objects and bookmarks as the two paragraphs are merged. Attempting to delete certain ranges can result in an invalid document structure in which case a 400 bad request error is returned. Some examples of invalid delete requests include: * Deleting one code unit of a surrogate pair. * Deleting the last newline character of a Body, Header, Footer, Footnote, TableCell or TableOfContents. * Deleting the start or end of a Table, TableOfContents or Equation without deleting the entire element. * Deleting the newline character before a Table, TableOfContents or SectionBreak without deleting the element. * Deleting individual rows or cells of a table. Deleting the content within a table cell is allowed.
